# CI Publishing Setup Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

Jarvis has successfully implemented a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for publishing the SST VSCode Extension to both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry.

### 🚀 CI/CD Workflows Created

1. **`.github/workflows/publish-extension.yml`**
   - Triggered by git tags (`extension-v*`) or manual dispatch
   - Runs tests on multiple platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
   - Builds and packages the extension
   - Publishes to both marketplaces simultaneously
   - Creates GitHub releases with automatic changelog
   - Uploads VSIX files as release assets

2. **`.github/workflows/release-extension.yml`**
   - Triggered by GitHub releases or manual dispatch
   - Simplified workflow for release-based publishing
   - Automatically uploads VSIX to the release

3. **`.github/workflows/validate-extension.yml`**
   - Validates extension package on PRs and pushes
   - Checks package contents and size
   - Ensures build quality before merging

4. **Updated `.github/workflows/testing.yml`**
   - Added extension package validation to existing tests
   - Ensures extension can be packaged successfully

### 🛠️ Helper Scripts

1. **`scripts/setup-publishing.bash`**
   - Interactive script to set up marketplace authentication
   - Guides through token creation and secret configuration

2. **`scripts/release-extension.bash`**
   - Automated release script with dry-run support
   - Handles versioning, git operations, and GitHub releases
   - Validates environment and prerequisites
   - Provides clear status updates

### 📦 Package Configuration

1. **Updated `apps/extension/package.json`**
   - Fixed repository URLs
   - Added marketplace metadata (keywords, gallery banner)
   - Added publishing scripts for both marketplaces
   - Added Open VSX publishing support

2. **Dependencies Added**
   - `ovsx` for Open VSX Registry publishing
   - Proper test configuration with VSCode test framework

### 📚 Documentation

1. **`docs/PUBLISHING.md`**
   - Complete guide for setting up publishing
   - Token creation instructions
   - Publishing methods explanation
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **`docs/CI-PUBLISHING-SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Implementation summary
   - Usage instructions

### 🔐 Security Configuration

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `VSCE_PAT`: Visual Studio Marketplace Personal Access Token
- `OVSX_PAT`: Open VSX Registry Personal Access Token

## 🚀 How to Use

### Method 1: Tag-based Release (Recommended)
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag extension-v1.0.0
git push origin extension-v1.0.0
```

### Method 2: Automated Release Script
```bash
# Test what would happen
./scripts/release-extension.bash 1.0.0 --dry-run

# Actually release
./scripts/release-extension.bash 1.0.0
```

### Method 3: Manual Workflow Dispatch
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Publish VSCode Extension"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter version and options

## 📊 What Happens During Publishing

1. **Testing Phase**
   - Runs linting and type checking
   - Executes unit tests and VSCode extension tests
   - Validates on multiple platforms

2. **Build Phase**
   - Updates package.json version
   - Builds extension with optimized bundle
   - Creates VSIX package

3. **Publishing Phase**
   - Publishes to VS Code Marketplace
   - Publishes to Open VSX Registry
   - Creates GitHub release with changelog
   - Uploads VSIX as release asset

4. **Notification Phase**
   - Success notifications
   - Links to published extensions

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Automated Publishing**: No manual steps required
2. **Dual Marketplace Support**: Reaches both VS Code and open-source users
3. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing before publishing
4. **Version Management**: Automated versioning and changelog generation
5. **Release Tracking**: GitHub releases with downloadable assets
6. **Developer Experience**: Clear scripts and documentation

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Set up authentication tokens** using `scripts/setup-publishing.bash`
2. **Test the workflow** with a pre-release version
3. **Create your first release** when ready

## 📈 Marketplace Links

Once published, your extension will be available at:
- **VS Code Marketplace**: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kairiss.sst-vsc-ext
- **Open VSX Registry**: https://open-vsx.org/extension/kairiss/sst-vsc-ext

The CI/CD pipeline is now ready for production use! 🎉
